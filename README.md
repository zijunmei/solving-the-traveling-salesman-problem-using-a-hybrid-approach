# solving-the-traveling-salesman-problem-using-a-hybrid-approach
Solving the traveling salesman problem using a hybrid approach<br>
Import required libraries: numpy, torch, matplotlib, and scipy.<br>

load_data(filename): Loads the TSP instance from a TSPLIB file, calculates the distance matrix between cities, and converts it into a PyTorch tensor.<br>

Generator and Discriminator: These are the neural network classes for the generator and discriminator used in the GAN.<br>

train_gan(): Trains the GAN using the generator and discriminator networks, optimizers, dataloader, and device.<br>

Genetic Algorithm related functions:<br>

initialize_population(): Initializes the population for the GA.<br>
selection(): Selects parents for the GA using roulette wheel selection.<br>
crossover(): Performs crossover between parents to generate offspring.<br>
mutation(): Applies mutation to the offspring population.<br>
evaluate_fitness(): Evaluates the fitness of the candidate solutions in the population.<br>
run_ga(): Runs the GA to improve candidate solutions.<br>
evaluate_population(): Evaluates the population by calculating the fitness scores of each individual.<br>
