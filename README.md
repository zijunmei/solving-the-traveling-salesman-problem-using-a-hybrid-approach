Solving the traveling salesman problem using a hybrid approach
Import required libraries: numpy, torch, matplotlib, and scipy.

load_data(filename): Loads the TSP instance from a TSPLIB file, calculates the distance matrix between cities, and converts it into a PyTorch tensor.

Generator and Discriminator: These are the neural network classes for the generator and discriminator used in the GAN.

train_gan(): Trains the GAN using the generator and discriminator networks, optimizers, dataloader, and device.

Genetic Algorithm related functions:

initialize_population(): Initializes the population for the GA.
selection(): Selects parents for the GA using roulette wheel selection.
crossover(): Performs crossover between parents to generate offspring.
mutation(): Applies mutation to the offspring population.
evaluate_fitness(): Evaluates the fitness of the candidate solutions in the population.
run_ga(): Runs the GA to improve candidate solutions.
evaluate_population(): Evaluates the population by calculating the fitness scores of each individual.
